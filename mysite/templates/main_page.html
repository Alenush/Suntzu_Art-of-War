                <p><b>Sun Tzu</b> (or Sun Zi) was a Chinese general, military strategist,
                    and philosopher who lived in the Spring and Autumn period of ancient China.
                    Sun Tzu is traditionally credited as the author of The Art of War,
                    a widely influential work of military strategy that has affected
                    both Western and Eastern philosophy.
                    Aside from his legacy as the author of The Art of War,
                    Sun Tzu is revered in Chinese and Asian culture as a legendary historical figure.
                    His birth name was Sun Wu, and he was known outside of his family by his
                    courtesy name Changqing. The name Sun Tzu by which he is best known in
                    the West is an honorific which means "Master Sun".</p>
